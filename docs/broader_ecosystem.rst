Python Spectroscopy Ecosystem
*****************************

muler is part of an ever-evolving ecosystem of Python packages for astronomical spectroscopy.  Here's how `muler` fits in.

sibling packages
----------------

`muler` has a closely-related sibling package named `gollum <https://gollum-astro.readthedocs.io>`_.  `muler` is the interface to *reduced data* and `gollum` is the interface to precomputed synthetic spectral models.  The main reason to separate these packages is to keep them smaller and more maintainable.  They share some common methods, like `normalize()` or `flatten()`, but overall the types of operations you perform on a model spectrum are different than those of a data spectrum. For one, a data spectrum has uncertainty whereas a model spectrum does not.  

parent packages
---------------

`muler`'s parent package is `specutils <https://specutils.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_.  `specutils` provides lots of the foundation for spectroscopy tasks, such as units, spectral axes, radial velocity, resampling, trimming, basic model fitting, among others.  To some extent, `muler` can be seen as a `fluent interface <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluent_interface>`_ wrapper around specutils.  We considered alternatives to specutils, such as pandas DataFrames, but in the end specutils appears to be the right choice.

The parent of specutils is `astropy <https://www.astropy.org>`_, which I suppose makes astropy the grandparent of `muler`.  

The data that muler consumes comes from data reduction pipelines.  We do not inherit any code from these pipelines and simply treat their products as standing alone, with fixed formatting.  We currently support HPF data from `Goldilocks <https://github.com/grzeimann/Goldilocks_Documentation>`_ and the closed-source HPF instrument team.  We support IGRINS data from the `plp <https://github.com/igrins/plp>`_, and we have preliminary support for data from the Keck NIRSPEC `NSDRP <https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/koa/nsdrp/nsdrp.html>`_.


community packages
------------------

There are dozens, maybe hundreds of actively maintained open source Python packages for astronomical spectroscopy.  Here we provide an incomplete curated list of some packages in this broader ecosystem.  muler has inherited ideas and code from some of these, and muler can serve as a pre-processing step to others, so this list can be thought of as a loosely connected family of tools.  We hope to see those interconnections bloom as existing projects grow and new ones sprout.

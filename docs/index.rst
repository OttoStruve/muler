Welcome to muler's documentation!
=================================

**μl·er**
`muler`
/myo͞olər/
*noun*

1. a portmanteau of *micron* (μm) and *ruler*
2. a Python Package for IGRINS data analysis

`muler` aims to simplify astronomical echelle spectroscopic data analysis through abstraction of common astronomy tasks.  The project structure allows users to customize these routine tasks for their science purpose, while providing sane defaults that will work for a broad range of use cases.  The architecture is based loosely on the `lightkurve <https://docs.lightkurve.org/>`_ framework, adapted to echelle spectroscopy data analysis.  We currently support the `IGRINS <https://www.as.utexas.edu/astronomy/research/people/jaffe/igrins.html>`_ spectrograph.  The project is currently in early stages of development, we hope you will provide community input on our `GitHub Issues page <https://www.github.com/OttoStruve/muler/issues>`_.

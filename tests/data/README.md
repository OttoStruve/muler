# Test data

You need to put some example data in here to run the tests.
Follow the instructions in the `installation` guide on the project documentation.

We currently recommend making a simlink to the `muler_example_data`:

```bash
ln -s ../../../muler_example_data ./muler_example_data
```

Your paths may vary, so visit the documentation for some futher guidance.
